# Submission for the 2024 Ricedathon Chevron Track

# Goal was to create a model that predicts Peak Oil Rate with the lowest RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)
# With all that missing data, find ways to reduce the RMSE. 
# Approaches we took were by imputation, outlier removal, statistical learning to find significane on variables and hyperameter tuning of          # our RandomForest Model
# We also found ways to reduce complexity/dimesionality reduction. We accomplished this by combining coordinate related variables and 
# finding how they relate. Helped us find redundant values and again reduce complexity to avoid overfitting.
# Overall a great project and learned a lot on how to deal with datasets with massive amounts of missing data!
# Check out our PDF slides for some insights on what we did and how we did!
